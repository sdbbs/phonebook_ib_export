This is a simple Python 3.x script that converts a `phonebook.ib` file, such
as the one generated by a Nokia 3310 backup, to vCard.

Created and tested ad-hoc on a single sample file, your mileage may vary.

The current version should be able to handle Nokia 3310 3G and Nokia 220 4G
`phonebook.ib` files.

## Examples

You can provide multiple `phonebook.ib` files on the command line - in that
case, the program performs the parsing and extraction of entries from all files
in a single merged internal representation, and only outputs a report on the
standard output (including check for empty fields and duplicates):

```lang-none
python3 export.py ../Backups/*/phonebook.ib
```

If you provide the `--outjson` argument, the merged internal representation
will be output as a JSON file:

```lang-none
python3 export.py ../Backups/*/phonebook.ib --outjson all_merged_contacts.json
```

Then you can copy this `all_merged_contacts.json` file to an
`all_merged_contacts_edit.json` file, which you can edit manually. If you
provide the `--injson` argument, then you can read in the edited file, and
use it to export directly a .vcf vCard file (without parsing input .ib files):

```lang-none
python3 export.py --injson all_merged_contacts_edit.json --outfile all_merged_contacts_edit.vcf
```

Otherwise, you can also export a .vcf directly from the result of parsing of the
input .ib files (without using a JSON file):

```lang-none
python3 export.py ../Backups/*/phonebook.ib --outfile all_merged_contacts_edit.vcf
```

Note that different models seem to require different formats for the .vcf file: for example, the .vcf import (Save vCard) on Nokia 215 4G **will fail** if the lines in the .vcf file are terminated with only line feeds - however, terminating the lines with CR LF will make the .vcf import on this device succeed.
